        <h2>Key Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. What are the challenges in learning/understanding the above concepts..</li>
            <li>  1) Algorithm Complexity and Optimization
                  •	Understanding and comparing the time and space complexities of different algorithms can be confusing
                  2) Difficulty with Graphs and Graph Algorithms
                  •	Graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra’s algorithm can be especially challenging because graphs are more abstract and   less intuitive than simpler data structures like arrays or linked lists
                  3) Handling Edge Cases
                  •	When implementing algorithms like graph traversals, sorting, or searching, students often forget to handle edge cases such as empty lists, cyclic graphs, or null values. 
                  4) Implementing Complex Algorithms
                  •	Even after understanding the theory behind an algorithm, us students often struggle with the actual implementation..</li>
            <li>2. What are challenges in correlating with real world applications..</li>
            <li>  1) Abstract Nature of Algorithms vs. Real-World Complexity
                  •	Many data structures and algorithms are highly abstract and often simplify or omit the complexities present in real-world systems. 
                  2) Data Structure and Algorithm Selection.
                  •	Choosing the right data structure or algorithm for a specific real-world problem can be daunting. 
                  3. Dynamic and Evolving Data.
                  •	Many algorithms assume static or pre-determined data, but real-world data is often dynamic, changing over time. 
                  4. Scalability and Efficiency
                  •	Many algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, sorting algorithms) are taught in isolation, without considering the scalability issues that arise in large-scale systems. .</li>
            <li>3)How do you determine the most efficient approach/design techniques when solving a complex problem. .</li>
            <li>  1. Understand the Problem Thoroughly.
                  2. Identify Relevant Data Structures.
                  3. Analyze the Problem Complexity (Time and Space).
                  4. Choose Between Simplicity and Optimized Solutions. .</li>
        </ul>
